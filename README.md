# Smart_Contract_Savings_Account
This is a smart contract for an Ethereum-based savings account. It is written in Solidity and will work in Ethereum-compatible blockchains like Hyperledger Fabric from the Linux Foundation, Quorum from J.P. Morgan, and Ethereum Classic

## Steps to Create a Smart Contract Using Solidity and the Remix IDE

* Define the business scenario where we want to use a smart contract.
* Architect the functionality of the smart contract, and define the functions.
* Create the code that implements the solution that we want to build.
* Compile the smart contract in the Remix IDE. If any errors occur, fix them.
* Deploy the smart contract in the Ethereum network.
