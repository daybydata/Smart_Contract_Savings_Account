# Smart_Contract_Savings_Account
This is a smart contract for an Ethereum-based joint savings account for eth. It is written in Solidity and will work in Ethereum-compatible blockchains like Hyperledger Fabric from the Linux Foundation, Quorum from J.P. Morgan, and Ethereum Classic.

## Steps to Create a Smart Contract Using Solidity and the Remix IDE

* Define the business use case.
* Translate the business requirements into a contract and set of functions.
* Write the smart contract in Solidity in a file ending in .sol.
* Compile the smart contract in the Remix IDE. If any errors occur, fix them.
* Deploy the smart contract in the Ethereum network.
